### Project Name
# Smart-Budget

## Project Description
Smart-Budget is a cute app for keeping your finances in order. In addition to mundane features like powerful multi-currency, several accounts, planned transactions and cloud synchronization for multiple devices in your family, it has something unexpected for a 'serious' app, like drawing stylish category icons with your finger.
